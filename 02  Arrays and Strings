The base class for all arrays is The Array class. It is defined in the System namespace. The Array class provides various properties and methods to work with arrays.

4.What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
the .count property can be used to count the total number of elements.
 Ex 1. string[] animals = { "Cat", "Alligator", "fox", "donkey", "Cat", "alligator" };
totalElements = animals.Count(); // answer is 6

5.Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No. System.Array is homogenous.


6.Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?

System.Array.CopyTo() takes a shallow copy of the array's elements and puts it in an already existing array that also needs to have the space to hold the size of the copied elements.

System.Array.Clone() takes a shallow copy of the array's elments and creates a brand new array from this copy. the new array does not have to pre-exist in this case.
